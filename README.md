# Pair-Words

A word-pairing game that makes language learning fun!

Learning a new language? The best way to build your vocabulary is through repetition—but who says it has to be boring? With Pair-Words, you’ll match words with their counterparts in different languages, reinforcing your memory while having fun. It’s simple, effective, and a great way to challenge yourself. Play, learn, and expand your vocabulary one pair at a time!

## Development Phases
The development of Pair-Words will be split into three phases:

1. Proof of Concept (POC) 🛠️

* This initial phase focuses on keeping things as simple as possible.
* No emphasis on scalability, security, or advanced features—just testing the core gameplay.
* The goal is to validate whether the game is fun and engaging.

2. Alpha Release 🚀

* If the POC proves successful (i.e., it's enjoyable and worth sharing), the project will move to this stage.
* The app will be deployed in an early-access form.
* Initial feedback from users will help refine gameplay and usability.

3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 🎯

* A fully developed version with essential features and improvements based on user feedback.
* Focus on scalability, security, and a more polished user experience.
* Ready for broader adoption and potential expansion.
